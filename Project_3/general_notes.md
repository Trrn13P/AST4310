We did: calculate mean, variance and create normal distribution. This is symmetric.
Reason why curve fitting can be benefitial: We might not have symmetric specral profiles. But we have quite low resultion in wavelength so might be hard to determine.

We should: First fit gaussian distribution, then calculate B-field ect.
Also: The gaussian distributions needs to be saved in file so that Kilian don't use a 100 years to run each code. So calculate gaussian and save, then we can load in code.
