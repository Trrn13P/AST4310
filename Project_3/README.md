TO-DO in programming:
- Create function that plots a line from a point to a point in plot and calculates the length of the line in kilometers. And puts this in text above the line. This should be able to do this for all plots. And all plots of the (x,y) grid should have a scale in the bottom left corner that shows how long 100km is, like on a map.
- Function that does this from hint "Widths of lines are measured in nm, but most commonly they are converted to km/s also using eq. (1), so that they can be better compared to velocities."
- Copy functions from p3 assignment for plotting line intensity and stokes v
- Find FWHM in interpolation plot. This is much much better than gaussian fit.

TO-DO in analysis:
- Find abnormalities in plots and compare magnetic field ect at these locations.
- Should we average intensity over all wavelengths to find abnormalities?

Questions to answer:

- Using spectral velocities and brightness temperatures, what can you tell about the solar granulation?
Which is cooler: the granules or the inter-granular lanes?
How are they moving in relation to us?

- In terms of spectral properties, what sets a sunspot apart from the neigbouring granulation?

- Do pores share the same spectral properties of sunspots? Are the two connected? - Where in a sunspot do you find the largest velocities? And the strongest magnetic fields?

- How much colder are sunspots than the solar granulation? Why are they dark?

- How does the size of this sunspot compare with planet Earth? 


Imagine you are one of the pioneers observing sunspots for the first time and know nothing about their properties. Your task is to analyse the SST dataset using the spectral diagnostics listed above. In your essay, you should report your findings to an audience of your peers who are similarly ignorant about sunspots, but knowledgeable about spectral analysis (so you don't need to explain what spectral lines are or what we can learn from them).

This exercise will be graded using the following criteria: * [28 points] **Diagnostics**: correctly extract physical quantities from the data. * [43 points] **Physical interpretation**: being able to relate the derived quantities to the physics in the solar atmosphere. * [24 points] **Presentation**: clear and concise text, appropriate plots and graphics, and connecting them in a coherent way.
